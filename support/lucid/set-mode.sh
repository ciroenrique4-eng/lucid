# way the theme that is active builds it normally:
#   matugen / pywal — wallpaper-derived, so the generator is re-run in the new
#                     mode and every template it owns is rewritten with it
#   colour          — built from one colour, so apply-colour.sh builds it again
#                     in the new mode
#   anything else   — a static palette, so apply-theme.sh picks (or synthesises)
#                     the theme's light variant
#
# the mode itself lives in ~/.cache/current_mode, beside current_theme, because
# the shell and these scripts both have to agree on it.
